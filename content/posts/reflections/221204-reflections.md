## Today's Song
>  Get away from their unkindness \
    But this time we should run together \
    You don't have to worry or hide \ 
    'Cause I get you with my heart \
    - 백예린의 "Popo" 중

## Today's Reflections
1. More Jobs
    - Applied to more jobs! - Mostly Banking and VCs :)
    - Got an online interview offer from one!! Yay!! Making progress
2. Bleached World
    - Difficult to maintain my composure in the face of other's success
    - I'm still a nobody, at least for now. I want to prove it to the world, but there just isn't a lot of chances for me. However, I will definitely try my best. 
    - Especially, I need to be of confidence, in order to confidentally congradulate other people's success. Or else, I won't be able to express it with my heart's content
3. Now Combined to a Weekly Reflection, updated every day.
    - For a more concentrated output
