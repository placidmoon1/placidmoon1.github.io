## Today's Song

>   All the colors and personalities\
    you can’t see right through what I truly am\
    you’re hurting me without noticing\
    I’m so, so broke like someone just robbed me\
    - 백예린의 "Square" 중

## Today's Goal
1. Founders 2기 면접 @ 1930, 서울 마포
2. Complete Job Application for: Bain, LG, Yanolja
3. CFA SN Ch.1 & Ch.2 
4. Polish Blog

## Today's Achievements
1. End of interview for Founders; results out on 30 NOV. Decent quality, but stuttered and wasn't specific enough, as there were some challenging questions. (65 / 100)
2. First overhaul of the blog: added table of contents for blog posts, changed blog color, and established initial guidelines on writing a post (95 / 100)
3. 2 hours on CFA (1.1, 1.2). (60 / 100)
4. 6000+ steps walked (total 8500) (90 / 100)

## Today's Reflection
1. Talk with quantitative evidence and confidence. Have a mix of humor and seriousness.
2. Spend more time in actual studying. Try to increase sheer amount of studying.
3. Allot time for reflection. Don't crush over this time just because you are tired.
