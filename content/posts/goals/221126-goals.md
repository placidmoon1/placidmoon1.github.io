    * Total cost: est. $70k
1. **Job Seek**
    * First tier: Top 3 Consulting intern, Top Tech Intern 
    * Second tier: Samsung, LG, Korean Tech, Boutique, Big 4 Intern
    * Third tier: 학원 / 과외 고수익 알바
2. **DGB Challengers**
    * Try to complete the program, and win first place.
    * However, still difficult to decide on whether to fully commit, as it would take up quite a bit of time and effort. 
3. **Start-up**
    * Trying to start from a Start-up Society, [Founders](https://ink-hydrogen-e1e.notion.site/Founders-25a92146944c4c09998af3e7d70aebf4).
    * Either RealValue, branded and polished to go, or other items & competitions
    * Need to earn money... but also exit and provide quality products at the same time. Very difficult times. 

## Life

    * Groom better, from hair to toe
    * Dress better

    * Persevere better
2. **Record, and don't lose**

    * *Spend time recording every day.*
